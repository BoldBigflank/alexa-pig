## Alexa Pig Latin Weather
This project has two abilities
* Translate a phrase to Pig Latin
* Tell the user the weather in Pig Latin

The translator takes each word, looks up its pronunciation in a dictionary, then converts it to Pig Latin.
When the user asks "What's the weather in {city} {state}", a short forecast is given to the user in Pig Latin.
